      p
        | We've tried to be both fair and clear—if you have any suggestions for improvement, feel free to email us at customer-service@fogcreek.com. We've also included annotations throughout this contract in quotes; these annotations aren't a part of the contract itself, but are intended to help you follow the text and to emphasize key sections.

      p
        | TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF FOG CREEK AND ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, CONSULTANTS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS AND/OR DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF FIFTY DOLLARS (US$50.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENTS GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

      h2
        | 13. Arbitration; Waiver of Class Actions

      p
        | “We'll arbitrate instead of going to court for many disputes. We'll only resolve disputes on an individual basis.”

      p
        | Any claim where (a) the total amount of the award sought by either you or Fog Creek is less than $10,000 and (b) that does not involve paten, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or moral rights, shall be resolved via binding non-appearance-based arbitration initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. In any such arbitration, the parties and AAA must comply with the following rules: (w) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, and the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (x) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; (y) the arbitrator may award injunctive or declaratory relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim; and (z) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, (1) either party may seek remedies in small claims court of competent jurisdiction and (2) either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.

      p
        | Any claims brought by you or us must be brought in that party's individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Neither you nor us will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by these Agreement. You hereby waive any and all rights to bring any claims related to these Agreement and/or our Privacy Policy as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. You may bring claims only on your own behalf.

      p
        | You may opt out of the agreement to arbitrate in the first paragraph of this Section 13 (“Agreement to Arbitrate”). If you do so, neither you nor we can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify us in writing within thirty (30) days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. The opt-out notice must state that you do not agree to the Agreement to Arbitrate and must include your name, address, phone number, your Account to which the opt-out applies and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate. You must sign the opt-out notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. You must use this address to opt out:

      p
        | Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any change to the arbitration procedures (other than a change to any notice address or Site link provided herein) in the future, that change shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against us prior to the effective date of the change.

        | 14. Jurisdiction

      h3
        | “This agreement is covered by New York law. If there is a dispute between us not subject to arbitration, we'll handle it in New York.”

      p
        | Before resorting to litigation, we strongly encourage you to contact us at customer-service@fogcreek.com to seek a resolution.

        | This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New York as they apply to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within New York between New York residents, without regard to conflict of law provisions.

              | “Glitch”:

When you use any of the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

        p
          | Because your privacy is important, we ask that you please read this Policy carefully. We've also included highlighted annotations throughout this policy in quotes; these annotations aren't a part of the policy itself, but are intended to help you follow the text and to emphasize key sections.

        h2
          | 1. Children

        h3
          | “We do not collect personally identifiable information from children.”

        p
          | The Services are not directed towards, and Fog Creek does not knowingly collect information from, children under the age of thirteen (13). If you are a parent and believe your child under the age of thirteen (13) has created a Services account or otherwise provided personal information to Fog Creek, please contact us at customer-service@fogcreek.com.

        h2
          | 2. What This Privacy Policy Covers

        h3
          |  “This Policy covers information you share with Fog Creek, not third parties.”

        p
          | This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications (“Third Party Services”) that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we don't manage or employ. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of all Third Party Services you access.

        h2
          | 3. What Information We Collect and How We Use It

        h3
          | Information Obtained from Third Party Services: “Fog Creek uses your data shared from third-party networks like Twitter and you should understand their policies.”

        p
          | Information about Your Accounts on Third Party Services: Key parts of the Services require you to link your Account to certain Third Party Services, including without limitation social networking services such as GitHub. In order to do so, you will provide your user ID and authentication on each of those Third Party Services, where we receive a token that allows us to access those accounts. We use this authorization as permission to, for example, retrieve your content or activity on those services.

        p
          | We do NOT ask for, receive or store your passwords for your Third Party Service accounts.

        p
          | For your convenience, you can view the GitHub Terms of Service here: <br> https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/

        p
          | And you can view the GitHub Privacy Policy here: <br> https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/

        p
          | We STRONGLY encourage you to familiarize yourself with the terms of service and privacy policy of any Third Party Services which you use in conjunction with Glitch.

        p
          | In some cases, when you connect your Account with your accounts on Third Party Services, we may obtain information about you from those Third Party Services. To the extent we obtain such information, we may use the information about you that we receive from Third Party Services to improve and personalize our Services. As a general practice, we strongly urge you to make careful judgments about any personal information you disclose to Internet services, including without limitation Glitch and any Third Party Services, regardless of whether you choose to link your accounts.

        h3
          | User Content: “Your Glitch activity is public by default.”

        p
          | By default, the information we get from your accounts with Third Party Services and the analysis generated by the Services regarding that information is public, and it is published so that anyone can view it. If you use our Services to edit your profile or content, that edit will become public and our Services will publicly show that you made the edit. You should assume that anything Glitch publishes for you is publicly accessible unless you have explicitly selected otherwise. Content published and shared publicly is accessible to everyone, including without limitation search engines. In addition, information shared publicly may be copied and shared throughout the Internet. While you are free to remove published content from or delete your Account, because of the nature of Internet sharing, copies of that content may exist elsewhere and be retained indefinitely, including without limitation in our systems.

        h3
          | Information About User Content: “Your content might have data embedded in it. We may use that data.”

        p
          | In some cases, we may collect information about content you provide to the Services. For example, when it's included with images, we may collect information describing your camera and camera settings. This information allows us to improve the Services and provide additional features and functionality.

        h3
          | Information Related to Use of the Services: “We use third party statistics and analytics services. Read their policies.”

        p
          | We collect information about how people use the Services, including without limitation those with an Account. This information includes general usage information, and may include information such as the number and frequency of our visitors, which pages or features of the Services they have visited, which links on the Services they have clicked on, and the length of those visits. We may also use third party applications and services, such as Google Analytics, to collect and analyze this information. This information enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use the Services so that we can analyze and improve them. Some of this information may be associated with the IP Address (as defined below) used to access the Services, and some may be associated with your Account, such as the topics you search for and the help pages that you visit. We may also use some of this information in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure related to all of our users that would not identify you personally. We use information about your use of the Services to improve and enhance your experience on the Services.

        p
          | For your convenience, you may view the Google Analytics Terms of Service: <br> http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html

        p
          | And you can view the Google Analytics Privacy Policy: <br? http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html

        h3
          | Information Related to Your Web Browser: “Web browsers typically send some data when you visit us; We use that to make Glitch better.”

        p
          | We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services, such as your browser type and version, what sort of device you are using, your operating system and version, your language preference, the website or service that referred you to the Services, the date and time of each web request you make, your screen display information, and information from any cookies we have placed on your web browser (as described below). We also sometimes detect whether you are using certain web browser extensions and store that information in a manner associated with your Account. Web browser-related information is used to enhance your experience with the Services (for example, by personalization) and to allow us to improve the Services; it is not, however, used in a manner that would identify you personally.

        h3
          | IP Address Information: “Normally, when you visit Glitch we receive your IP address, which we'll use to improve Glitch.”

        p
          | When you log into the Services or load a web page from the Services, we will collect and store your Internet Protocol Address (“IP Address”). We generally use IP Address information to fight spam, malware, and identity theft; we also may use it, in the future, to personalize the Services for you. IP Address information is also used by us to generate aggregate, non-identifying, information about use of the Services.

        h3
          | Location Information: “If we receive your location information, we'll use it to provide better Glitch services to you.”

        p
          | In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP Address into a rough geolocation, or by using location data stored in photos or in social media messages. We may use location information to improve and personalize the Services for you.

        h3
          | Information Collected Using Cookies: “We use cookies to make Glitch work for you. If you turn them off, you won't be able to use Glitch. Some statistics services we use set cookies, too.”


        p
          | Cookies are pieces of information that may be sent to and saved by your web browser when you access a website; your web browser stores these cookies in a way associated with each website you visit, and you can see your cookies through your browser settings. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use the Services. Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain information that personally identifies you, and we don't combine the general information collected through cookies with other information to tell us who you are. However, we do use cookies to identify that you have logged in and that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services, and we may associate that information with your Account if you have one. This information, in turn, is sometimes used to personalize your experiences on the Services, such as by presenting you with a different feature when you are logged in to Glitch. Most web browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on your web browser software) allowing you to decide to accept each new cookie in a variety of ways. If you disable cookies, you won't be able to log into your Account, and so will not be able to use the vast majority of our Services; as such, we don't recommend disabling your cookies when using the Services. Some third-party services that we use, such as Google Analytics, may also place their own cookies on your browser. Note that this Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.

        p
          | We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals as there is no industry standard for compliance.

        h3
          | Information About Your Contacts: “Glitch may automatically retrieve your friend or follower list from connected services.”

        p
          | Certain features of the Services allow you to provide us with your contact lists stored on other services. We only use and store that information to provide the Glitch service to you.

        h3
          | Derived Information: “We may deduce information about you from your activity. We only do that to provide Glitch services to you.”

        p
          | We analyze your actions on the Services in order to derive or infer characteristics that may be descriptive of you. These characteristics are used to improve and personalize the Services.

        h3
          | Email Tracking: “We may sometimes put a tracking link in emails to know if you opened an email or clicked on a link in it.”

        p
          | We may place information in our emails to you (such as a web beacon) that allows us to measure our email deliverability, and we may track which links in an email are followed. We may also use  third-party email services to deliver messages and you should review the policies of these services which govern these messages as well.

        h2
          | 4. Remarketing

        h3
          | “You may see more advertising for Glitch when you browse the web.”

        p
          | In the future, we may use marketing services provided by Google and other third parties that allow us to deliver advertising to users after they leave our Services that they will see elsewhere on the web. This is a common practice called “remarketing.” Users will not see more ads than they otherwise would see as a result of remarketing; rather, the ads they see are more likely to be ads for Glitch products and services. Google (and any other third party marketing services providers we use to help us with remarketing) use cookies as part of the remarketing service. For more information regarding remarketing and the ability to opt-out, please visit:

        h2
          | 5. With Whom Your Information Is Shared

        h3
          | “We don't share your personal information without telling you.”

        p
          | We never share personal information we receive from you unless: (a) we have your permission to share that information; (b) we have given you prior notice (such as within this privacy policy) that the information will be shared, and with whom; or (c) that information is aggregate information or other information that does not identify you.

        h3
          | Information Shared with the Public Through the Services: “Your Glitch contributions are public by default.”

        p
          | As noted above, by default, content published through the Services is shared with the public, and this is an important feature of the Services. Such information includes, but isn't limited to, anything you choose to post on or submit to a connected service and anything apparent in posted content. Because this kind of information can be seen by anyone and may be indexed by search engines (like Google), you should be careful in what you choose to disclose publicly and make sure it is information you want to share with everyone.

        h3
          | Information Shared Between the Services: “We might combine your use of different networks together to improve Glitch.”

        p
          | We may, if possible, aggregate information about your use of multiple Services and use that consolidated information to improve how the Services operate, and to develop new Services.

        h3
          | Information Shared with Our Agents in Order to Operate and Improve the Services: “If we hire a contractor or consultant, they'll follow the same policy here.”

        p
          | In some cases, we share information that we store (such as IP Addresses) with third parties, such as our service providers, consultants and other agents (“Agents”), for the purposes of operating and improving the Services. For example, we may share information with service providers in order to fight spam, and third-party consultants may have access to information in the process of improving our processes and technology. Agents with whom we share such information for these reasons are generally bound by confidentiality obligations and, unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use information we share with them beyond the scope and duration of what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of your information with our Agents.

        h3
          | Information Shared with Third Parties: “If we share information with business partners, it would be aggregate information.”

        p
          | We may share or disclose non-private information, information that is aggregated with information relating to other Service user that does not personally identify you, or other non-personally identifiable Information with people and entities that we do business with.

        h3
          | Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers: “If we sell Glitch or its assets, your information would come along in the sale.”

        p
          | In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell business assets. In these transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

        h3
          | Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others: “We will disclose information if needed to obey the law or to protect people.”

        p
          | We believe in freedom of expression, and we will work to protect our community from baseless legal demands. That said, we must reserve the right to access, preserve, and disclose any information we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any law, regulation, legal process, governmental request, or governmental order, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including without limitation investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues (including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention), (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property, health, or safety of us, our users, any third parties, or the public in general, including but not limited to situations involving possible violence, suicide, or self-harm.

        h3
          | Information We Share with Your Consent or at Your Request: “If you want to share your data, we'll accommodate you.”

        p
          | If you ask us to release information that we have about your Account, we will do so if reasonable and not unduly burdensome.

        h2
          | 6. The Security of Your Information

        h3
          | “We're keeping your data reasonably safe.”

        p
          | Your Account information is protected by a password or by connection to a Third-Party Service for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your Account and personal information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your Account on the Services.

        p
          | We use reasonable measures to protect your information (including your Account information) to ensure that it is kept private; however, we can't guarantee the security of any information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.

        h2
          | 7. What Information You Can Access

        h3
          | “You can see your account information in your Settings page.”

        p
          | If you are a registered user, you can access and delete most information associated with your Account by logging into the Services and deleting projects or content. Registered and unregistered users can access and delete cookies through their web browser settings.

        p
          | Your California Privacy Rights: Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal customer information that we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: 55 Broadway, 25th Floor, New York, NY 10006.

        h2
          | 8. How to Delete Your Account and What Happens When You Delete Your Account

        h3
          | “You can email us to close your account, and we'll delete your account. Some information may persist for a while after your account is deleted.”

        p
          | If you want to delete your Account, you can do so from your Membership page or by emailing us at customer-service@fogcreek.com and providing proof of authority over the Account. What constitutes “proof of authority” will vary depending on the circumstances, but generally will require sufficient identifying information so that we can be confident you are the Account owner. Deleting your Account does not remove the content you have published from our systems and we may continue to use the content in accordance with our Terms of Service. In addition, given the nature of sharing on the Services, the public activity on your Account prior to deletion may remain stored on our servers and accessible to the public. Even after you delete your Account, there may be records of any contributions you have made to projects created by others.

        h2
          | Changes to This Privacy Policy

        h3
          | “We may change this privacy policy. If we do, we'll tell you.”

        p
          | We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, using the process for modifications set forth in our Terms of Service. Use of information we collect now is subject to the current version of our Privacy Policy regardless of when we collected the information.

        h2
          | Where to Direct Questions or Concerns

        h3
          | “Seriously: If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, email us.”

        p
          | If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using the Services, please send us a detailed message to customer-service@fogcreek.com.

          | This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications (“Third Party Services”) that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we don't manage or employ. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of all Third Party Services you access.

Content published and shared publicly is accessible to everyone, including without limitation search engines. In addition, information shared publicly may be copied and shared throughout the Internet. While you are free to remove published content from or delete your Account, because of the nature of Internet sharing, copies of that content may exist elsewhere and be retained indefinitely, including without limitation in our systems.

          | Information About User Content: “Your content might have data embedded in it. We may use that data.”

        p
          | In some cases, we may collect information about content you provide to the Services. For example, when it's included with images, we may collect information describing your camera and camera settings. This information allows us to improve the Services and provide additional features and functionality.

        h3
          | Information Related to Use of the Services: “We use third party statistics and analytics services. Read their policies.”

        p
          | We collect information about how people use the Services, including without limitation those with an Account. This information includes general usage information, and may include information such as the number and frequency of our visitors, which pages or features of the Services they have visited, which links on the Services they have clicked on, and the length of those visits. We may also use third party applications and services, such as Google Analytics, to collect and analyze this information. This information enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use the Services so that we can analyze and improve them. Some of this information may be associated with the IP Address (as defined below) used to access the Services, and some may be associated with your Account, such as the topics you search for and the help pages that you visit. We may also use some of this information in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure related to all of our users that would not identify you personally. We use information about your use of the Services to improve and enhance your experience on the Services.

        p
          | For your convenience, you may view the Google Analytics Terms of Service: <br> http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html

        p
          | And you can view the Google Analytics Privacy Policy: <br? http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html

        h3
          | Information Related to Your Web Browser: “Web browsers typically send some data when you visit us; We use that to make Glitch better.”

        p
          | We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services, such as your browser type and version, what sort of device you are using, your operating system and version, your language preference, the website or service that referred you to the Services, the date and time of each web request you make, your screen display information, and information from any cookies we have placed on your web browser (as described below). We also sometimes detect whether you are using certain web browser extensions and store that information in a manner associated with your Account. Web browser-related information is used to enhance your experience with the Services (for example, by personalization) and to allow us to improve the Services; it is not, however, used in a manner that would identify you personally.

        h3
          | IP Address Information: “Normally, when you visit Glitch we receive your IP address, which we'll use to improve Glitch.”

        p
          | When you log into the Services or load a web page from the Services, we will collect and store your Internet Protocol Address (“IP Address”). We generally use IP Address information to fight spam, malware, and identity theft; we also may use it, in the future, to personalize the Services for you. IP Address information is also used by us to generate aggregate, non-identifying, information about use of the Services.

        h3
          | Location Information: “If we receive your location information, we'll use it to provide better Glitch services to you.”

        p
          | In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP Address into a rough geolocation, or by using location data stored in photos or in social media messages. We may use location information to improve and personalize the Services for you.

        h3
          | Information Collected Using Cookies: “We use cookies to make Glitch work for you. If you turn them off, you won't be able to use Glitch. Some statistics services we use set cookies, too.”


        p
          | Cookies are pieces of information that may be sent to and saved by your web browser when you access a website; your web browser stores these cookies in a way associated with each website you visit, and you can see your cookies through your browser settings. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use the Services. Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain information that personally identifies you, and we don't combine the general information collected through cookies with other information to tell us who you are. However, we do use cookies to identify that you have logged in and that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services, and we may associate that information with your Account if you have one. This information, in turn, is sometimes used to personalize your experiences on the Services, such as by presenting you with a different feature when you are logged in to Glitch. Most web browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on your web browser software) allowing you to decide to accept each new cookie in a variety of ways. If you disable cookies, you won't be able to log into your Account, and so will not be able to use the vast majority of our Services; as such, we don't recommend disabling your cookies when using the Services. Some third-party services that we use, such as Google Analytics, may also place their own cookies on your browser. Note that this Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.

        p
          | We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals as there is no industry standard for compliance.

        h3
          | Information About Your Contacts: “Glitch may automatically retrieve your friend or follower list from connected services.”

        p
          | Certain features of the Services allow you to provide us with your contact lists stored on other services. We only use and store that information to provide the Glitch service to you.

        h3
          | Derived Information: “We may deduce information about you from your activity. We only do that to provide Glitch services to you.”

        p
          | We analyze your actions on the Services in order to derive or infer characteristics that may be descriptive of you. These characteristics are used to improve and personalize the Services.

        h3
          | Email Tracking: “We may sometimes put a tracking link in emails to know if you opened an email or clicked on a link in it.”

        p
          | We may place information in our emails to you (such as a web beacon) that allows us to measure our email deliverability, and we may track which links in an email are followed. We may also use  third-party email services to deliver messages and you should review the policies of these services which govern these messages as well.

        h2
          | 4. Remarketing

        h3
          | “You may see more advertising for Glitch when you browse the web.”

        p
          | In the future, we may use marketing services provided by Google and other third parties that allow us to deliver advertising to users after they leave our Services that they will see elsewhere on the web. This is a common practice called “remarketing.” Users will not see more ads than they otherwise would see as a result of remarketing; rather, the ads they see are more likely to be ads for Glitch products and services. Google (and any other third party marketing services providers we use to help us with remarketing) use cookies as part of the remarketing service. For more information regarding remarketing and the ability to opt-out, please visit:

          | 5. With Whom Your Information Is Shared

        h3
          | “We don't share your personal information without telling you.”

        p
          | We never share personal information we receive from you unless: (a) we have your permission to share that information; (b) we have given you prior notice (such as within this privacy policy) that the information will be shared, and with whom; or (c) that information is aggregate information or other information that does not identify you.

        h3
          | Information Shared with the Public Through the Services: “Your Glitch contributions are public by default.”

        p
          | As noted above, by default, content published through the Services is shared with the public, and this is an important feature of the Services. Such information includes, but isn't limited to, anything you choose to post on or submit to a connected service and anything apparent in posted content. Because this kind of information can be seen by anyone and may be indexed by search engines (like Google), you should be careful in what you choose to disclose publicly and make sure it is information you want to share with everyone.

        h3
          | Information Shared Between the Services: “We might combine your use of different networks together to improve Glitch.”

        p
          | We may, if possible, aggregate information about your use of multiple Services and use that consolidated information to improve how the Services operate, and to develop new Services.

        h3
          | Information Shared with Our Agents in Order to Operate and Improve the Services: “If we hire a contractor or consultant, they'll follow the same policy here.”

        p
          | In some cases, we share information that we store (such as IP Addresses) with third parties, such as our service providers, consultants and other agents (“Agents”), for the purposes of operating and improving the Services. For example, we may share information with service providers in order to fight spam, and third-party consultants may have access to information in the process of improving our processes and technology. Agents with whom we share such information for these reasons are generally bound by confidentiality obligations and, unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use information we share with them beyond the scope and duration of what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of your information with our Agents.

        h3
          | Information Shared with Third Parties: “If we share information with business partners, it would be aggregate information.”

        p
          | We may share or disclose non-private information, information that is aggregated with information relating to other Service user that does not personally identify you, or other non-personally identifiable Information with people and entities that we do business with.

        h3
          | Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers: “If we sell Glitch or its assets, your information would come along in the sale.”

        p
          | In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell business assets. In these transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

        h3
          | Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others: “We will disclose information if needed to obey the law or to protect people.”

        p
          | We believe in freedom of expression, and we will work to protect our community from baseless legal demands. That said, we must reserve the right to access, preserve, and disclose any information we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any law, regulation, legal process, governmental request, or governmental order, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including without limitation investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues (including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention), (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property, health, or safety of us, our users, any third parties, or the public in general, including but not limited to situations involving possible violence, suicide, or self-harm.

        h3
          | Information We Share with Your Consent or at Your Request: “If you want to share your data, we'll accommodate you.”

        p
          | If you ask us to release information that we have about your Account, we will do so if reasonable and not unduly burdensome.

        h2
          | 6. The Security of Your Information

        h3
          | “We're keeping your data reasonably safe.”

        p
          | Your Account information is protected by a password or by connection to a Third-Party Service for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your Account and personal information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your Account on the Services.

        p
          | We use reasonable measures to protect your information (including your Account information) to ensure that it is kept private; however, we can't guarantee the security of any information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.

        h2
          | 7. What Information You Can Access

        h3
          | “You can see your account information in your Settings page.”

        p
          | If you are a registered user, you can access and delete most information associated with your Account by logging into the Services and deleting projects or content. Registered and unregistered users can access and delete cookies through their web browser settings.

        p
          | Your California Privacy Rights: Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal customer information that we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties.

          | 8. How to Delete Your Account and What Happens When You Delete Your Account

        h3
          | “You can email us to close your account, and we'll delete your account. Some information may persist for a while after your account is deleted.”

        p
          | If you want to delete your Account, you can do so from your Membership page or by emailing us at customer-service@fogcreek.com and providing proof of authority over the Account. What constitutes “proof of authority” will vary depending on the circumstances, but generally will require sufficient identifying information so that we can be confident you are the Account owner. Deleting your Account does not remove the content you have published from our systems and we may continue to use the content in accordance with our Terms of Service. In addition, given the nature of sharing on the Services, the public activity on your Account prior to deletion may remain stored on our servers and accessible to the public. Even after you delete your Account, there may be records of any contributions you have made to projects created by others.

        h2
          | Changes to This Privacy Policy

        h3
          | “We may change this privacy policy. If we do, we'll tell you.”

        p
          | We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, using the process for modifications set forth in our Terms of Service. Use of information we collect now is subject to the current version of our Privacy Policy regardless of when we collected the information.

        h2
          | Where to Direct Questions or Concerns

        h3
          | “Seriously: If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, email us.”

        p
          | If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using the Services, please send us a detailed message to customer-service@fogcreek.com.
